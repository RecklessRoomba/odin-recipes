    <h4>Description</h4>
        <a>A deliciously simple soup. Perfect for any weeknight dinner.</a>
    <h4>What You'll Need</h4>
        <ul>6 potatoes</ul>
        <ul>3 whole Carrots</ul>
        <ul>1 onion</ul>
        <ul>3 stalks of celery</ul>
        <ul>6 slices of bacon</ul>
        <ul>salt, to taste</ul>
        <ul>pepper, to taste</ul>
        <ul>1/2 tsp. cajun spice mix</ul>
        <ul>8 c. low sodium chicken broth</ul>
        <ul>3 tbsp. flour</ul>
        <ul>1 c. milk</ul>
        <ul>1/2 c. heavy cream</ul>
        <ul>1 tsp. minced parsley</ul>
        <ul>1 c. grated cheddar cheese</ul>
    <h4>How to Make It</h4>
    <ol>    
        <li>Dice all of the vegetables. The potatoes need to be separate from the other veggies as they go in a little later in the cooking process. The other veggies can all be in the same bowl.</li>
        <li>To a soup pot over medium heat, add the bacon and cook until crisp. Remove bacon and set it aside. Pour off most the grease, but do not clean the pot.</li>
        <li>Return the pot to medium-high heat and the onion, carrot, and celery. Stir and cook for 2 minutes, then add the diced potatoes. Cook for 5 minutes, season with salt, pepper, and cajun spice.</li>
        <li>Pour in the broth and bring to a gentle boil. Cook for 10 minutes or until the potatoes begin to tender. Whisk together the flour and milk, then pour into the soup and allow the soup to cook for another 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove two thirds of the soup and blend, either in a blender or food processor until smooth. Use caution when blending hot soup; if possible allow soup to cool beforehand. Pour it back into pot and stir to combine. Let it heat back up as you taste for seasonings. Add more of whatever it needs. Stir in the cream, then add the cheese, bacon, and parsley.</li>
    </ol>
